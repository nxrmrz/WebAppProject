# WebAppProject
A full-stack web application made in a team of 3 for our postgraduate Javascript programming class

# How to run:
1. Clone the files into a directory in your local machine
2. Whilst in the root directory (with the public and views folders), install required node.js modules by running npm install
3. Run the app.js script from your choice of IDE or from the shell

# Technologies/languages used
MySQL, Javascript (vanilla, node, jQuery, AJAX), HTML/CSS, front-end frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, handlebars)

# My contributions:
1. Coded the full-stack and wrote the SQL queries for viewing, adding, editing and deleting articles from our blog.
2. Programmed the front and back-end for creating a new user profile and also wrote SQL queries to ensure our database gets updated with the relevant information. I’ve also written the code for our avatar selection, avatar upload, and Image Resizing features
3. Coded in the AJAX call for checking username availability in our database when a user first signs up. This feature prompts the user via a message to pick a new username if they were to sign up with a pre-existing name stored in the database. This feature also disables the user profile creation submit button if a username has already been taken.
4. Implemented our WYSIWYG editor as well. We have chosen the free and open-source CKEditor for this, which was our primary choice due to its ease of implementation. I’ve also helped in designing and coding the overall look of our blog, mainly using bootstrap templates
